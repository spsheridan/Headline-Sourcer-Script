# Headline Sourcer Script
This short script reads through a news database and fetches headlines that contain keywords that inputted by the user. Alternatively, the program can generate fake headlines from standard formats inputted by user.

##Description
This program takes in a large CSV of historical headlines as an input. It then checks each headline for certain keywords inputted by the user, and if the headline contains the given keywords, then the headline is placed into another CSV for use in other projects. Alternatively, the user can generate headlines by using the arrays of standard needed words such as companies, countries, diseases and drugs.
